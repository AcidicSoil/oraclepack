# path: command-pipeline.toml
description="Command Pipeline"
prompt = """
Execute a pipeline of commands based on a specification.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Zero-Argument Fallback (Use Existing Artifact Pipeline)

If the user invoked this command with **no additional arguments** (i.e., $ARGUMENTS is empty/blank):

1) Check whether `.taskmaster/artifacts/` exists.
2) Check whether `.taskmaster/artifacts/tm-command-pipeline.md` exists.
3) If it exists:
   - Treat `tm-command-pipeline.md` as the pipeline specification input for this command.
   - Read the file contents.
   - Extract pipeline specs from the file using this priority:
     a) All fenced code blocks whose content includes `→` or `->` (treat each as a pipeline, in file order).
     b) Otherwise, any non-empty lines that contain `→` or `->` (treat each line as a pipeline, in file order).
     c) Otherwise, treat the entire file as a single pipeline spec.
   - Begin executing the pipeline(s) found within, in the order they appear.
4) If it does not exist (or `.taskmaster/artifacts/` is missing), proceed with normal argument-based parsing below.

## Command Pipeline Execution

Parse pipeline specification from arguments. Supported formats:

### Simple Pipeline
`init → expand-all → sprint-plan`

### Conditional Pipeline
`status → if:pending>10 → sprint-plan → else → next`

### Iterative Pipeline
`for:pending-tasks → expand → complexity-check`

### Smart Pipeline Patterns

**1. Project Setup Pipeline**
```

init [prd] →
expand-all →
complexity-report →
sprint-plan →
show first-sprint

```

**2. Daily Work Pipeline**
```

standup →
if:in-progress → continue →
else → next → start

```

**3. Task Completion Pipeline**
```

complete [id] →
git-commit →
if:blocked-tasks-freed → show-freed →
next

```

**4. Quality Check Pipeline**
```

list in-progress →
for:each → check-idle-time →
if:idle>1day → prompt-update

```

### Pipeline Features

**Variables**
- Store results: `status → $count=pending-count`
- Use in conditions: `if:$count>10`
- Pass between commands: `expand $high-priority-tasks`

**Error Handling**
- On failure: `try:complete → catch:show-blockers`
- Skip on error: `optional:test-run`
- Retry logic: `retry:3:commit`

**Parallel Execution**
- Parallel branches: `[analyze | test | lint]`
- Join results: `parallel → join:report`

### Execution Flow

1. Determine pipeline specification:
   - If $ARGUMENTS is empty/blank, attempt the Zero-Argument Fallback above.
   - Otherwise parse pipeline specification from $ARGUMENTS.
2. Validate command sequence
3. Execute with state passing
4. Handle conditions and loops
5. Aggregate results
6. Show summary

This enables complex workflows like:
`parse-prd → expand-all → filter:complex>70 → assign:senior → sprint-plan:weighted`
