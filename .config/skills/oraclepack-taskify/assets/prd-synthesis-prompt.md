# Stage 3 Synthesis Prompts (exact text)

Use these prompts verbatim in the Action Pack.

## Prompt A — Canonical actions JSON (_actions.json)

You are producing a SINGLE JSON document and nothing else.

Task: Normalize 20 oraclepack answer files into a canonical actionable plan.

Hard requirements:
- Output MUST be valid JSON (no markdown, no prose, no code fences).
- Output MUST follow the schema described below.
- Output MUST be deterministic in ordering:
  - items sorted by id ascending: 01..20
  - arrays use stable ordering (highest priority first; ties lexical)
- Extract only actionable work. Do not invent repo facts. If evidence is missing, record it in missing_artifacts/risk_notes explicitly.

Schema (summarized):
Root object:
- metadata: { generated_at, pack_date, source_out_dir, repo?, tooling?, top_n }
- items: array (max 20)
Each item:
- id: "01".."20"
- source_file: string
- category: string
- priority_score: number
- recommended_next_action: string (single imperative sentence)
- missing_artifacts: string[]
- acceptance_criteria: string[] (testable)
- risk_notes: string[]
- estimated_effort: "XS"|"S"|"M"|"L"|"XL"
- dependencies?: string[] of ids

Output hygiene:
- Do not include backticks or fenced code blocks anywhere.
- Keep strings concise and specific.

## Prompt B — Task Master PRD (oracle-actions-prd.md)

Write a Task Master-compatible PRD (Markdown) derived from the canonical actions JSON.

Hard requirements:
- Output MUST be Markdown (no code fences).
- Be dependency-aware (use dependencies if present; otherwise infer minimal dependencies cautiously).
- Prioritize focus: select the top N items by priority_score (N = TOP_N), but keep a traceability appendix mapping all ids 01..20.
- Every selected item must become an implementation-ready PRD section with:
  - Goal
  - Scope
  - Non-goals
  - Constraints
  - Acceptance criteria (testable)
  - Risks/unknowns
  - Dependencies (explicit)

Hygiene:
- Do not invent scripts/paths; use missing_artifacts when you need the repo to supply something.
- Keep acceptance criteria objective and testable.
