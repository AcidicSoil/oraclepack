# Code Preservation Protocol

**CRITICAL**: When modifying ANY existing file, NEVER overwrite it without first reading and analyzing its full current content. 

ALWAYS merge new changes into the existing codebase to strictly preserve ALL previous functionality, logic, and features. 

DO NOT rely on memory or assumptions about the file's state.
