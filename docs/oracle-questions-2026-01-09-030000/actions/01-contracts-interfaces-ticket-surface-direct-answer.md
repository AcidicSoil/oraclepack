Direct answer

* Clarify/document Action Pack execution semantics (CLI/TUI docs surface): steps run as `bash -lc ...` in the project root, and oraclepack’s “special handling” (flag injection/override validation) applies only to commands beginning with `oracle`; non-`oracle` tools (`tm`/`task-master`, `codex`, `gemini`) run directly as shell commands.  
* Dispatcher/command-detection contract expansion: broaden detection beyond the oracle-anchored regex (`^(\\s*)(oracle)\\b`) so steps containing `tm`/`task-master`, `codex`, and `gemini` can be treated as first-class command targets for dispatch/override/validation inclusion. Back-compat: preserve existing behavior for `oracle ...` commands. 
* Override-validation behavior change (TUI/validate surface): today validation targets only oracle invocations (runs `oracle --dry-run summary`) and skips steps without oracle lines; tickets imply extending/restructuring validation so steps containing `tm`/`task-master`, `codex`, `gemini` are not silently excluded purely due to prefix mismatch. Back-compat: do not regress the current oracle-only validation flow.  
* `ticket-action-pack.md` content contract change: replace placeholder steps (explicitly 09–13 and 16) with headless `gemini` + non-interactive `codex exec` automation. Back-compat: keep the pack “oraclepack-ingestible” (single bash fence, `# NN)` steps) and keep Steps 01–07 semantics unchanged.  
* New standardized output artifact interface under `.oraclepack/ticketify/` for the agent loop: Step 09 `next.json`, Step 10 `codex-implement.md`, Step 11 `codex-verify.md` and/or `gemini-review.json`, Step 16 `PR.md`. Back-compat: paths are treated as required/stable outputs (don’t rename/move without versioning).  
* Tool-availability/skip semantics become part of the operational contract for these steps: add `command -v ...` guards and documented “skip” behavior to avoid hard failures when `codex`/`gemini` are missing or interactive (blocking risk). Back-compat: default runs should not newly fail just because optional tools aren’t installed.  
* Taskify Action Pack generator surface change: add an opt-in “agent-mode” (suggested `mode=codex` / `mode=gemini`) that swaps the existing autopilot entrypoint step slot after Task Master expansion, while keeping the 20-step contract intact. Back-compat: default mode remains current behavior; agent-mode must not add steps. 
* Output/reporting contract stability: tickets explicitly name run outputs/artifacts (e.g., `.oraclepack/ticketify/_tickets_index.json`, `_actions.json`, `.taskmaster/docs/tickets_prd.md`, `.oraclepack/ticketify/tm-complexity.json`, plus `ticket-action-pack.state.json` / `ticket-action-pack.report.json`) and restate project-root execution (no chdir to `out_dir`). Back-compat: keep these names/locations stable to avoid breaking consumers and user expectations.
